# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions - Marketing Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the AlphaCare Insurance Solutions Marketing Analytics Project. The project aims to analyze historical insurance claim data to optimize the marketing strategy and identify "low-risk" targets for potential premium reduction.

## Business Objective
The primary objective of this project is to help AlphaCare Insurance Solutions tailor their insurance products more effectively to meet consumer needs and preferences. The project involves the following key tasks:

1. Task 1: Git and GitHub
   - Create a git repository for the project and demonstrate proficiency in version control using Git and GitHub.
   - Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

2. Task 2: Project Planning - EDA & Stats
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the provided historical insurance claim data.
   - Apply statistical thinking and techniques to analyze and interpret the data.

3. Task 3: Data Version Control (DVC)
   - Install and configure Data Version Control (DVC) to manage and document versions of datasets and analysis results.

4. Task 4: A/B Hypothesis Testing
   - Conduct A/B hypothesis testing to evaluate risk differences across provinces and zip codes.
   - Analyze significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes.
   - Evaluate significant risk differences between women and men.

5. Task 5: Statistical Modeling
   - Develop linear regression models to predict total claims for each zipcode.
   - Build a machine learning model to predict optimal premium values based on various features related to the insured car, owner, and location.
   - Assess the explanatory power of important features in the model.
